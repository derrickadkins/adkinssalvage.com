					I needed to replace a damaged wheel on my sonâ€™s impala. 
					Nice people, courteous service. They told me it would take 
					some time to get the wheel as they were short on help. They 
					called me as soon it was ready, which was pretty fast. I 
					highly recommend.

					They are amazing. They have fixed several of our vehicles 
					over the years. They are very friendly and professional and 
					knowledgeable. Their prices are fair. We have referred several 
					families that have been happy with them as well over the years. 
					They can even repair our Mercedes quickly and reasonable.

					Sydney was very helpful & the price for my repair was amazing!! 
					Volkswagen wanted to charge me $1000 & they did the job for under 
					$350! Very pleasant experience will definitely use in the future 
					for any repairs as well as recommend to other. Thank you again, Patsy.
					<br/>
					Went here again about 3weeks ago to have the other regulator in my 
					window replaced. Price was the same as before & they were able to 
					squeeze me in super fast! Thanks again!

					Chuck is the only mechanic I trust with my vehicles. I've moved an hour away and 
					I still make the drive/tow to take my vehicles to him. He is honest and has always 
					taken the best care of me. I love that he has a junk yard and can reuse parts to 
					save me time and money. The ladies at the shop are great! They always seem happy 
					to be working and are very knowledgeable about there job. If you need anything go 
					see Chuck he owns and runs it.

					Customer service is a big deal to me, and this place always treats me with so much 
					patience and respect (despite the fact that I know much less about cars than I probably 
					should seeing as how I use a car almost daily). They're a little bit further away than 
					other places, but they do good work and have fair prices. They have a really sweet dog 
					that is always there, too!

					Great experience and very nice staff. They squeezed me in on a busy day and I couldn't 
					be more thankful. I will defiantly use them again and recommend them to others.
